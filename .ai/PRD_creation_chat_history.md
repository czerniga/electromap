You are an experienced product manager tasked with creating a comprehensive product requirements document (PRD) based on the following descriptions:

<project_description>
.ai/MVP_Specification.md
</project_description>

Follow these steps to create a comprehensive and well-organized document:

1. Divide the PRD into the following sections:

a. Design Overview

b. User Problem

c. Functional Requirements

d. Project Boundaries

e. User Stories

f. Success Metrics

2. In each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the project description and answers to the clarifying questions. Ensure that:
- You use clear and concise language
- You provide specific details and data where necessary
- You maintain consistency throughout the document
- You address all points listed in each section

3. When creating user stories and acceptance criteria
- List ALL necessary user stories, including baseline, alternative, and extreme scenarios.
- Assign a unique requirement identifier (e.g., US-001) to each user story for direct traceability.
- Include at least one user story specifically for secure access or authentication if the application requires user identification or access restrictions.
- Ensure that no potential user interactions are omitted.
- Ensure that each user story is testable.

Use the following structure for each user story:
- ID
- Title
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria

4. Once the PRD is complete, review it against this checklist:
- Is each user story testable?
- Are the acceptance criteria clear and specific?
- Do we have enough user stories to build a fully functional application?
- Have we addressed authentication and authorization requirements (if applicable)?

5. Formatting the PRD:
- Maintain consistent formatting and numbering.
- Do not use bold formatting in markdown ( ** ).
- List ALL user stories.
- Format the PRD in correct markdown.

Prepare a PRD with the following structure:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - tictactoe
## 1. Product Overview
## 2. User Problem
## 3. Functional Requirements
## 4. Product Boundaries
## 5. User Stories
## 6. Success Metrics
```

Remember to fill out each section with detailed, relevant information based on the project description and our clarifying questions. Make sure the PRD is comprehensive, clear, and includes all the relevant information needed to further develop the product.

The final output should consist solely of a PRD following the specified markdown format, which you will save as an .ai/prd.md file.
