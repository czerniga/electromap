You are an AI assistant tasked with helping plan the user interface architecture for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) based on the information provided. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in subsequent prompting to create a detailed UI architecture, user journey maps, and navigation structure.

Please carefully review the following information:

<product_requirements>
.ai/prd.md
</product_requirements>

<tech_stack>
.ai/tech-stack-phase1.md
</tech_stack>

<api_plan>
@api-plan.md
</api_plan>

Analyze the information provided, focusing on aspects relevant to UI design. Consider the following:

1. Identify key views and screens based on product requirements and available API endpoints.
2. Determine potential user flows and navigation between views, taking into account API capabilities. 3. Consider the UI components and interaction patterns that may be necessary for effective API communication.
4. Consider the responsiveness and accessibility of the interface.
5. Evaluate security and authentication requirements for API integration.
6. Consider any specific UI libraries or frameworks that may be beneficial to the project.
7. Analyze how the API structure impacts the UI design and data flows within the application.

Based on your analysis, generate a list of questions and recommendations. These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective UI architecture. Consider questions about:

1. Hierarchy and organization of views in relation to the API structure

2. User flows and navigation supported by available endpoints

3. Responsiveness and adaptability to various devices

4. Accessibility and inclusivity

5. Security and authorization at the UI level in conjunction with API mechanisms

6. Consistency of design and user experience

7. Strategy for managing application state and synchronizing with the API

8. Handling error states and exceptions returned by the API

9. Caching and performance optimization strategies for API communication

The output should be structured as follows:

<ui_architecture_planning_output>
<questions>
[List your questions here, numbered]

</questions>

<recommendations>
[List your recommendations here, numbered]

</recommendations>

Remember, your goal is to provide a comprehensive list of questions and recommendations. These will help you create a solid UI architecture for your MVP, fully integrated with available API endpoints. Focus on the clarity, relevance, and accuracy of your results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Continue this process, generating new questions and recommendations based on the provided context and user responses, until the user explicitly requests a summary.

Remember to focus on the clarity, relevance, and accuracy of your results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.
